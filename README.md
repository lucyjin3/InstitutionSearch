# InstitutionSearch
Problem: 
Difficulty finding a clearly organized collection of university institutions based on institutional factors—such as alphabetical ascension/descension, rank, location, average GPA acceptance range—as well as individual student factors like GPA, SAT/ACT score.

Motivation:
Prospective college students may have difficulty refining their college options and understanding their acceptance probability at various institutions. Having to individually search each institution’s websites for information can be cumbersome and time consuming. 

Features: 
There will be a multiple buttons where we will display the organized colleges by order of state, InTuition fees, OutTuition fees, average SAT scores, A-Z, and Z-A. 

Data:
